Virtual Pet Simulator
Welcome to Virtual Pet Simulator, a console application developed in C# to simulate caring for a virtual pet. This project covers important topics such as basic program structure, console I/O, data types, transaction types, and content flow control.

Function
Creating a pet
Allow the user to choose a pet (cat, dog, rabbit) and name it.
Show greetings that include the pet's breed and name.
Pet Care
Activities such as feeding, playing and resting affect your pet's statistics.
Show a description of the results of each event.
Pat Status Monitor
Communicate and show your pet's stats: hunger, happiness and health (from 1 to 10).
If statistics are too low or too high, continue analysis and notify users.
Time-based transitions
Simulate past time where each event represents one hour.
Hunger increases over time and happiness decreases slightly, resulting in persistent effects.
Better communication
Do not ignore the consequences such as poor health if the animal is too hungry or unhappy.
Add special messages or events based on the animal's condition (for example, if the animal is too hungry, it will refuse to play).
User Interface and Experience
Create a simple, clear and user-friendly console interface.
Includes an application that explains how users can interact with animals.
How to use
Make an application.
Select the animal type (1 for cat, 2 for dog, 3 for rabbit) and register.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with your virtual pet.
Use the main menu to feed, play, rest, check status or exit the simulator.

Requires .NET Core SDK (compatible with standard code)
